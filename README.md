# Traffic Light System Project Repository

## Overview
This repository contains resources for the **Traffic Light System Project**, created as part of the **Professional Aptitude Test** for the **Electronics, Automation, and Control Technician course** at **Cior Professional School** in 2018. The project's goal was to educate children about traffic safety and citizenship through an interactive traffic light simulation.

The repository includes:
- **Project Report**: A comprehensive document detailing the project's concepts, design, and implementation.
- **Presentation**: A PowerPoint summarizing the project for educational use.
